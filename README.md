BankDemo is a simple yet comprehensive Java console-based banking application designed to simulate the fundamental operations of a real-world bank account system. The project allows users to interact with different types of accounts, perform common banking tasks, and navigate through a clear, menu-driven interface.

Beyond basic functionality, the application is built to showcase key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java. It demonstrates how inheritance enables code reuse across multiple account types, how encapsulation protects sensitive data like account balance, how method overriding allows subclasses to define their own specific behaviors, and how polymorphism ensures flexible and dynamic method handling at runtime.

Overall, BankDemo serves as an excellent learning project for understanding OOP concepts, creating structured console applications, and implementing real-world banking logic in Java.
