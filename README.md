# BankDemo — Java Console Banking System

**BankDemo** is a Java console-based banking application that simulates the core operations of a bank account system. It provides a menu-driven interface for creating and managing accounts, making deposits and withdrawals, checking balances, and demonstrating account-specific behavior. The project is designed as a learning-focused demo for Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java.

## 🔹 Overview

This application models typical bank workflows in a simplified, educational format:

- Create and manage bank accounts (account number, initial balance)
- Deposit and withdraw funds with basic validations
- View account balance and account details
- Support for multiple account types (e.g., Savings, Current) through OOP design
- Menu-driven console UI for straightforward interaction

The code emphasizes OOP principles such as **inheritance**, **encapsulation**, **method overriding**, and **polymorphism**, making it ideal for beginners learning how to structure real-world Java programs.

- Check account balance at any time
- Demonstrates account-specific behavior via subclasses (if included)
- Simple, clear, menu-based console interface for continuous transactions
- In-memory management (no external database), suitable for a demo or assignment

- Language: **Java**
- Input handling: `BufferedReader` or `Scanner` (depending on implementation in file)
- OOP: Classes, inheritance, encapsulation, method overriding, polymorphism
- Collections (optional): lists/maps if multiple accounts are managed
- Basic input validation and control flow
